before deploying the webapp online, we need a virtual environment, which is a clear installation of Python
it should be in a folder next to the webapp's folder

(for all this we need the python 'virtualenv' library: pip install virtualenv)

so the dir tree should be like this:
\app4_first_website\site     -- the folder contains the scripts and other files
\app4_first_website\virtual  -- the folder contains the virtual environment

First go to the project folder:
	> cd D:\...\app4_first_website

Create a virtual environment to a folder "virtual":
	...\app4_first_website> python -m venv virtual

Install all the required packages by pointing (!!) to the clear, virtual python installation's pip app, by adding the whole file path to the new folder: 
	...\app4_first_website> virtual\Scripts\pip install flask
